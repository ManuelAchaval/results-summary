## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- SCSS preprocessor
- BEM
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

Throughout this project, I followed a mobile-first approach, prioritizing the design and development for smaller screens. This methodology allowed me to focus on delivering a seamless and optimized user experience for mobile devices. As the project progressed, I seamlessly transitioned to desktop design, ensuring that the website maintains its responsiveness and functionality across different screen sizes. By adopting a mobile-first strategy, I was able to create a design that adapts and scales effectively from mobile to desktop, providing a consistent and user-friendly experience across all devices.

With this project, I reviewed BEM concepts. It has been a while since I last used it, so it may not be fully optimized. If you have any suggestions on how to improve it, they are welcome.

I have a better understanding of how to position elements within other elements and also how to nest classes within elements or other classes.


### Continued development

I am eager to further enhance my coding skills by exploring more efficient approaches to writing code using the BEM methodology. I strongly believe that there is room for improvement in my current implementation, with the goal of achieving better reusability, cleaner code, and eliminating repetitive classes.
